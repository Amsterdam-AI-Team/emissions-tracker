# emissions_tracking

This repo serves as a demo of how we track emissions within the AI Lab of the municipality of Amsterdam.


## Background

As the AI Lab we would like to be able to track the climate impact (CI) of (the modelling part of) our projects. 
This is because development and usage of AI models can cause significant environmental impact.
The goal of tracking is to facilitate:

- Awareness
    - We want to create awareness, for ourselves and for users, what the environmental impact of the AI model is
- Reduction
    - Identifying what the relative impact of different parts of the process is allows for focused optimization and impact reduction
- Comparison
    - When an AI system is proposed, insight in the environmental impact can help in (the discussion about) the benefits vs. (environmental) costs
